# Basic Python Algorithms

This repository is a collection of basic algorithms implemented in Python as an introduction to the Python language. These are being put together to be demonstrated as part of a talk to the Buckeye Hackers student group at Ohio State University, presented by Stephen Hara. 

## Overview

The talk took approximately one hour, with a live demonstration and explanation accompanying the first three topics. The last bullet is a more open "hey, let's take a look at what the community around Python has built to make complicated problems way easier to solve!"

* Sorting (2-3, depending on time) - basic introduction to the syntax
* A* pathfinding - classes and cool algos
* American Express Centurion candidates - list comps and more classes
* Basic look at some of the super cool Python libraries available

Spoiler alert, these have all been implemented in a subdirectory of this repo, but these implementations should be used as a guide rather than as the full demonstration, because it's not a very good learning experience to just watch someone explain what code does.
